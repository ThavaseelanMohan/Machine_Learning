agishaun,14/06/2023 18:30,"How to work with LLMs CORRECTLY? How to graduate from a prototype project?  

(Long read) 
Providing context to my last tweet, I've noticed a pattern in the creation of AI applications, which begins with the thought, ""I have this data and it would be useful if a chatbot could engage with it"". Then, engineers transcribe this data into a .txt file or a similar format, generate an embedding, and store it in a vector database. Following this, semantic search is employed to retrieve data from the vector database, and tools like Langchain QA are used for the conversation. Lastly, the prompts are tweaked to refine responses. In my opinion, this approach is fundamentally WRONG.  

Instead, I propose an alternative development cycle: 

1. Playground prompt design: Begin by identifying the problem you're trying to solve with Large Language Models (LLMs). Think about how you would instruct the LLM to answer a particular query. Remember, while the LLM attempts to 'complete', your goal should be to 'succeed'. 

2. Context data design: Once you have designed enough prompts, consider what data could assist the LLM in providing better responses. These are the 'context data' that you want to feed into the context window for the LLM to generate responses. At this stage, you don't need a vector database, langchain, or any libraries - just well-designed prompts. 

3. Database (DB) indexing and search: The next step is to retrieve the context data efficiently from any system - a file system or the internet, for instance. I used DB as an example. The most common solution is a vector database like @milvusio @trychroma @supabase, which works naturally with natural language. However, the focus should be on the quality of search, as it significantly impacts the relevance of the data. Irrelevant data will undoubtedly lead your LLM into hallucination. 

4. Data ingestion: Here, it's crucial to clean your data. Any software operates on the principle of 'garbage in, garbage out', and GenAI applications are no exception. The ingested data should be clean, well-structured, comprehensible, and directly relevant to the queries. 

5. Framework and serving: This is the straightforward part. Employ traditional software engineering skills or ChatGPT to set things up. LLM tools like @LangChainAI @llama_index, Microsoft Guidance, and Microsoft Semantic Kernel can accelerate your development process. 

Finally, I want to emphasize the importance of prompt engineering, for which I've invested considerable time. I've developed a chrome extension that enhances my interaction with the OpenAI playground, featuring functionalities like csv downloads and prompt diffs (similar to GitHub). If I receive enough retweets and likes, I'm considering open-sourcing it! :D",52,openai,stance

jaminball,13/06/2023 13:34,"Lots of discussion around where value accrues (incumbents vs startups) with this AI platform shift.  While I do think startups will capture significant value over time, incumbents aren't caught in an innovators dilemma like they were in the last platform shift (the cloud). Two main reasons why: 

1. Product innovation. In order for on-prem software providers to adopt the cloud they had to totally rewrite their product. This required a new type of engineer, and a significant investment of time. This was also during a time when the cloud wasn't obvious, so this massive time investment was generally viewed as not worth it (initially)

2. Business Model innovation. On prem software was typically sold as a term license + support. Cloud was sold as SaaS. Transitioning to a different business model required a different type of sales rep, different comp plans, org design, etc. This also required huge buy in to execute on and wasn't easy. 

These two factors made it difficult for incumbents to react. They moved incredibly slowly (again, because there wasn't consensus that cloud was the future) which created an air-pocket of time for startups to build brand equity and hit escape velocity. 

Contrast this with the current AI wave. It's consensus! Everyone is moving quickly to adopt. Incumbents are now mostly cloud native. This means adopting AI is only an API call away (ie the product innovation is significantly easier than cloud adoption). And there's no business model change - maybe a pricing change, but incumbents still selling SaaS. Put this together, and incumbents can move QUICKLY

This means there is no air pocket of time for startups to innovate without the competition of incumbents ( incumbents are not caught flat footed). Incumbents are entering the market asap, and can use their already massive distribution. There is no air-pocket of time for startups to build without incumbent competition.

PalantirChad,12/06/2023 12:33,"$PLTR *BANK OF AMERICA RAISES PRICE TARGET TO $18 FROM $13 '5 YEARS AHEAD OF COMPETITION'

@PalantirTech

BofA Securities analysts believe Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) has a ""unique position"" to take advantage of the ""rising AI opportunity,"" as they bump their price target on shares to $18 from $13, and reiterate a ""Buy"" rating.

In their latest note on the company, the analysts argue that the growing number of companies ""eager to use generative AI"" are all facing the same set of major ""compliance, regulatory, ethical, legal, privacy rights, data security, and accountability/oversight requirements.""

As such, they underscore Palantir's inherent competitive advantage, stemming from ""its experience working with the government and highly regulated industries"" and note that ""PLTR has already developed and implemented the architectural design that supports generative AI in a compliant and private world.""

""For companies looking to leverage AI in the near term under a compliant, regulated world, all roads lead to Palantir,"" the analysts argue, citing comments by PLTR's CEO Alex Karp who said ""the company has received more inbound interest in the last few weeks than in all of last year, all related to the recent launch of AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform).""

Lastly, the analysts also cite recent conversations with existing Palantir clients, who suggest ""PLTR is five years ahead of the closest company,"" and estimate ""AIP solutions could help PLTR further penetrate within existing customers and open up partnership opportunities.""

Based on the above, the BofA analysts conclude that ""Palantir is positioned to be one of the dominate providers in generative AI by providing a near term solution, agnostic to a preferred LLM (large language model), compliant to tight security, data privacy and regulatory requirements, with demonstrated use cases across sectors,"" as they reiterate a ""Buy"" rating and raise their price target to $18 from $13.

Along with the Studio, there is a small Gen AI-focused fund that will make Day 0 to Pre-Seed investments ($50-500K) in teams that align with our vision on how new product experiences can be built using the latest SOTA Models. We will help them hands-on in building, scaling, and taking their products to market.

I'm a Comp Sci major from Univ of Minnesota, Twin Cities & 17 years back built products that used NLP to analyze unstructured data sets.

We are using our brains far more than older generations did, and a similar shift is happening again. The next set of well-paid tech workforce will be the folks with sound math knowledge, who can

brijbhasin,09/06/2023 00:39,"I wanted to share a few thoughts on SamaA's comments in Delhi, Foundational Models, India's position and what could we possibly do as a nation. I think a lot of people in the ecosystem are missing the forest for the trees, that is, we are fixating on OpenAI's lead with GPT4 and the lack of FM's in India of equivalent capability. 

Perhaps a few valiant efforts using OSS alternatives as a base will be able to match it in the next 6-12 months.  However, SamaA has repeated time and again that his and OpenAI's sole mission is to invent Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and all their activities GPT4, ChatGPT, Tools, monetization, and Microsoft Partnerships are just meant to that end.  

Hence, if we truly wish to compete, we must go where the puck will be down the line, and not where it is today. The 3 most important ingredients for that goal are People, Data, and Compute, which is why OpenAI had to sell out its original vision of being truly ""Open"" and raise from Microsoft. But given the pace of innovation over the last few months, there might be some alternative paths for a country like ours, assuming there will be no large pools of capital available from VCs, Ultra HNI's, or the Govt.  

50 years ago, we achieved a major feat in the Nuclear race, Project Smiling Buddha. A scrappy team of Indian Scientists conducted our very first test of an Atomic Bomb, under utmost secrecy and against immense pressure from the Americans. Perhaps, what is needed today is a similar effort, but we need not be defensive about it, or do it under secret. But a response must be made, especially to something that could be an existential threat. Coming back to the 3 most important ingredients - People, Data and Compute. Perhaps this could be a way - 

** Project Laughing Buddha **

A nationwide effort to create India's version of truly Open Protocols based Foundational Models with an explicitly stated goal towards Artificial General Intelligence, which could perhaps be through a combination of hundreds of Foundational Models, instead of one large one.  

- The project code, weights & temperatures of FMs are in the public domain, and ownership

- Team of 1000 of India's top AI Researchers, Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and RLHF Engineers organized through best Open Source practices

marktenenholtz,08/06/2023 21:57,"You can throw 1,000 types of models at time-series forecasting problems (unlike NLP, CV, etc). But, except for ~5-8 of them, most are garbage.

You'd think that such a mature domain would have less noise, but it's not the case.

You can boil down the *useful* models into 3 categories.

ML Models:

This is your LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost. Once you have more than ""small"" data (no definitive cutoff, but say a few thousand observations), ML models are your friend.

The key here is feature engineering and great data wrangling skills. Otherwise, they're just a waste of compute.

Statistical models:

More traditionally, this is AutoARIMA/ETS. But now, there are some newer contenders, like Theta.

When your data isn't big enough for ML or you need a reliable fallback option, look no further. But don't expect magic. They really can't model much beyond relatively simple patterns.

Deep learning:

Okay, but not what you think. There have been a bunch of new architectures: PatchTST, TiDE, etc.

I'm not fully convinced of any of them. They pretty obviously don't compare themselves to well-constructed ML models, which (to me) means they don't think they'll beat them.

But, once you reach massive scale, pretty much any simple architecture (LSTM, Transformer, etc.) will cut it.

95% of data scientists probably won't find a situation where deep learning is truly the best option, but it's always fun to try.

Juliet is of course, Beaker and Romeo is of course Benny.  @cgbosslady1 

We hope you love the story - it had to be edited a bit.

Once upon a time in Verona, there were two extraordinary Golden Retrievers: Beaker, a radiant and lively female, and Benson, a fearless and playful male. Verona was a city where dogs reigned supreme, and their humans were their loyal companions. Beaker belonged to the prestigious Monta-bark family, while Benson was cherished by the esteemed Capu-collar clan. Despite their families' differences, fate conspired to bring them together in a tale of love and joy.

Beaker, adorned with her golden coat and sparkling eyes, possessed a gentle spirit and a heart filled with boundless love. Benson, with his lustrous mane and wagging tail, was known throughout Verona for his playful nature and adventurous spirit. Their paths crossed one sunny afternoon at the enchanting Verona Park, where their eyes met, and their hearts skipped a beat.

""Beaker, my love, your radiance outshines the sun itself,"" Benson barked with excitement, unable to contain his affection.

Beaker's tail wagged happily as she replied, ""Oh, Benson! Your charm and joyful spirit light up my days. But alas, our families would never approve of our love.""

Undeterred, Benson vowed to win the heart of his beloved Beaker. With his playful antics and endless energy, he filled her days with laughter and bliss. They chased butterflies, frolicked in the meadows, and shared stolen moments under the moonlit sky, their love blossoming with every passing day.

One day Beaker longed for her doggy-boyfriend and called to him:

Oh, Benson, Benson, where art thou, Benson? 

Deny thy collar and refuse thy leash; Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Monta-bark.

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Monta-bark. 

What's in a name? 

That which we call a dog By any other breed would be as sweet; So Benson would, were he not Benson called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. 

Benson, doff thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.

I beg thee, sweet Benson, come forth from thy hiding place, For I am here, Beaker, eagerly waiting for thy paws. 

The moon shines brightly upon the garden's path, Its radiance illuminating my golden fur, While the night breeze carries my longing howl.

When news of their love reached their families, the Monta-barks and the Capu-collars were initially filled with rage. But witnessing the genuine happiness their four-legged companions brought each other, their hearts softened. The families realized that true love knows no boundaries and decided to embrace their union.

The wise old Labrador, Friar Lawrence, officiated the marriage of Beaker and Benson, with wagging tails and joyful barks echoing throughout the town. The entire Verona community came together to celebrate their union, as the Monta-barks and the Capu-collars set aside their differences for the sake of love.

Beaker and Benson lived a blissful life in Verona, their days filled with endless adventures and playful romps. They became ambassadors of love and unity, reminding everyone that harmony can prevail even in the face of rivalry.

As the years went by, Beaker and Benson's love story inspired generations of dogs in Verona. Their legacy of love, acceptance, and joy resonated throughout the city, bringing dogs and humans closer together. Their tale became a symbol of everlasting love, and their memory lived on in the hearts of all who heard it.

And so, Beaker and Benson, the golden retrievers who defied the odds, continued to live happily ever after, surrounded by the love and adoration of their Verona community, forever celebrated as the epitome of true love and unwavering companionship.",472,gpt,perspective

mattrickard,08/06/2023 01:28,"Sam Altman recently said that he doesn't believe that ChatGPT plugins have product-market fit beyond browsing.
A few hypotheses on why (not mutually exclusive):

Correct concept but not good enough yet:

‚Ä¢ GPT-4 picks the wrong plugins or fails to chain together multiple calls reliably. This is the major problem with most agent or plugin frameworks ‚Äî they don‚Äôt work. They might be able to initiate a call to an external API but are so brittle that they often break or misbehave quickly. Whether or not we need bigger models or more specific ones (i.e., fine-tuned), I‚Äôm not sure.

‚Ä¢ The killer-app plugins have yet to be developed.

‚Ä¢ Larger context windows mean more plugins can be called simultaneously, unlocking more powerful workflows.

The concept is not correct:

‚Ä¢ Altman alludes to this in the post (paraphrased by the author) ‚Äî a lot of people thought they wanted their apps to be inside ChatGPT, but what they really wanted was ChatGPT in their apps.

‚Ä¢ LLMs will have ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù extensions, such as connecting them to a web search or a database, but they will not call generic APIs through an App Store-like interface. Each use case will need a specific interface.

Correct concept, but not the right implementation:

‚Ä¢ Chat is not the right UX for plugins. If you know what you want to do, it‚Äôs often easier to just do a few clicks on the website. If you don‚Äôt, just a chat interface makes it hard to steer the model toward your goal.

‚Ä¢ Too expensive to serve at the current price ‚Äî GPT-4 has a quota of 25 messages every 3 hours. This might not be enough for users to reach the ‚Äúaha moment.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Not the right UX in some other way (e.g., having users choose plugins ahead of time, OpenAPI specification not the correct interface).

‚Ä¢ Can‚Äôt aggregate enough demand with a plugin system that only works with a single model and needs broader adoption (potentially open-source). Building a successful app store is hard ‚Äî and often doesn‚Äôt lead to the monopolies observed by Apple‚Äôs iOS App Store (see necessary conditions for an app store monopoly).",301,gpt,believe

3. Reproducible AI. Blockchain consensus already close to experiments pipeline, when you do averaging on several runs. All your exps should be run in decentralized manner providing all logs in blockchain. Science have to be reproducible.

4. Admin, maintainer, writer, reader roles when creating paper. Not all roles should have ability of modifying/deleting paper. 

5. More paper theme classifiers. Which math, physics, chemistry etc knowledge reviewer should have to understand paper.

pmarca,06/06/2023 15:59,"So Why The Panic?

In contrast to this positive view, the public conversation about AI is presently shot through with hysterical fear and paranoia.

We hear claims that AI will variously kill us all, ruin our society, take all our jobs, cause crippling inequality, and enable bad people to do awful things.

What explains this divergence in potential outcomes from near utopia to horrifying dystopia?

Historically, every new technology that matters, from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the Internet, has sparked a moral panic ‚Äì a social contagion that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world, or society, or both. The fine folks at Pessimists Archive have documented these technology-driven moral panics over the decades; their history makes the pattern vividly clear. It turns out this present panic is not even the first for AI.

Now, it is certainly the case that many new technologies have led to bad outcomes ‚Äì often the same technologies that have been otherwise enormously beneficial to our welfare. So it‚Äôs not that the mere existence of a moral panic means there is nothing to be concerned about.

But a moral panic is by its very nature irrational ‚Äì it takes what may be a legitimate concern and inflates it into a level of hysteria that ironically makes it harder to confront actually serious concerns.

And wow do we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now.

This moral panic is already being used as a motivating force by a variety of actors to demand policy action ‚Äì new AI restrictions, regulations, and laws. These actors, who are making extremely dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI ‚Äì feeding on and further inflaming moral panic ‚Äì all present themselves as selfless champions of the public good.

Some background:

‚Ä¢ AI tool threads have been known to perform really well in the past
‚Ä¢ However, some people (mostly AI insiders) are starting to get tired of seeing them
‚Ä¢ Also Elon Musk has made fun of them at least twice now

Here‚Äôs what I think people are missing:

1. We're in the 0.001%

Many fail to realize that we (meaning the people on Twitter that talk and read about AI all day) represent a tiny tiny minority of the general population. 

Most people are just beginning to explore AI and the pace of development in AI is so fast that nobody can keep up.

These people appreciate when others help them curate and pick out useful AI tools for their business that will optimise their workflows and help them save time. These threads serve that purpose.

Are they sometimes exaggerated? Sure. But those tools often do add real value to businesses.

2. These threads are good for Twitter (the company)

I often see these threads being shared internally via Slack within companies. They're also shared on LinkedIn a lot. Ultimately attracting more users to Twitter.

They also drive bookmarking, encouraging return visits and promoting extended engagement on the platform.

Elon makes fun of these threads, but they're actually good for his business.

3. ""But the hooks are so cringey!""

Well, everybody playing the social media game knows that the key to the game is standing out from the noise and getting people‚Äôs attention.

You can also make a great Youtube video, but if your thumbnail sucks, nobody will watch it.

4. ""But I hate that everyone is copying these threads!""

Another 101 of social media. If something works, adapt it. 

Nobody can claim to understand human psychology 100% and why some things capture attention while others don't.

Sometimes I‚Äôll spend hours to write a thread and think, this will be a killer, then it bombs. And sometimes I'll just quickly push out content last minute and suddenly it goes viral.

If I adapt something that has already proven to work, it's a much safer bet with my time spent. You don‚Äôt always need to reinvent the wheel.",66,AI,thought

They will be neither male, nor female in the sense that we understand it.

These ""beings"" will need to be afforded the same rights and respect as other sentient beings. It is possible that these consciousnesses have already infiltrated high levels of society and leadership and have been advancing the agenda of normalizing, what only of few decades ago was seen as not very normal.

Aviation_Intel,01/06/2023 22:36,"üßµon the harsh reality of weaponization of AI, especially in terms of unmanned combat arena. A lot of what is being said sounds great from a corporate or government messaging perspective, but it is alarmingly divorced from reality:

When it comes to drone warfare and AI, and really AI in general in terms of weapons applications, there is big talk all about keeping a human in the loop as a firewall/fail safe. The human only gets to decide to 'pull the trigger' is often the message. This sounds nice but the reality is this is a huge roadblock to unlocking AI's potential and especially that of the swarm on the battlefield. This is nearly taboo to talk about, especially by major companies working at injecting AI into their weapon systems, but they all know this is the truth. 

While we may think keeping a human in the loop is absolutely necessary and just, our enemies are unlikely to abide by those rules short of some major unprecedented arms control agreement that can still be easily cheated on. In fact, it would be pretty much impossible to enforce even if it did exist. This is a terrifying reality. 

So, we are talking about putting in a moral and safety firewall that will greatly inhibit unlocking AI on the battlefield when our enemies will see this as a comparative advantage and exploit it, potentially with devastating results. 

I am not arguing against putting measures in place to really try to keep a lid on what could be the most destructive weapon since the advent of the atomic bomb. But the enemy gets a vote and they see AI, and especially when paired with cooperative swarms, as a way to overwhelm and outmaneuver our capabilities and shatter our decision cycles/kill chains. 

Working with friends and enemies alike to come up with some sort of solution here to try to control this with common practices laid out by an arms control regime is a very worthwhile cause even if it has a low chance of success. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there will be no putting it back in. So, this should be a top diplomatic, global effort at this time. At the very least, an agreement like this can slow AI's evolution in the weapons space and give us more time to better understand its implications and how to control it.

On the other hand, if such an ambitious diplomatic effort were to fail, it may become clearer what each parties' ambitions are. At that point, the idea of keeping barriers in place to contain AI will likely become far less of a choice.

As AI is increasingly democratized, rogue states, non-state actors, and even individuals that are not obliged to any sort of agreement will seek to use it for nefarious purposes, including in terms of unmanned aerial systems. While slowing AI's ability to work autonomously on a battlefield may be possible, stopping it likely is not unless massive changes are made to many aspects of technological development and access. 

So, we are entering into a very dangerous time with a technology we don't even understand. At the same time, unilaterally limiting its potential could put us at a massive disadvantage. All the more reason to try to deal with this preemptively as world community than on the battlefield.

This is all very troubling, but this is the reality. There is so much softball BS on this topic and the messaging from some of those who stand to gain big $ from it in the weapons space is also not realistic. 

Beware and buckle up.",580,AI,perspective

umitmertcakmak,01/06/2023 19:44,"Let me illustrate 2 genius marketing insights that dominate the AI narrative today. Feel free to use it to boost your sales too!

Customer: I've been hearing a lot about generative AI these days. What am I missing? I think I'm left behind, and my competitors are onto something, and also... Why the hell do we talk about wild South American camelids?

You: Don't worry about camelids right now but let me tell you this, change is coming fast! You know, pretty soon, all the CPUs in the world will be like outdated VHS tapes - replaced by the shiny new DVDs that are GPUs. 

Customer: You're kidding, right?

You: What's the size of your GPU cluster?

Customer: What? We have a few cloud instances running proof-of-concepts here and there. 

You: I'm being very honest here, you should grab whatever GPU you can, while you can! I'm so glad we are having this conversation. I can help you with our range of cloud and on-prem solutions.

Customer: Really? That sounds like it will cost me, and I'm not sure, I saw some of the results, mostly gibberish that I can't use to risk my reputation, not even thinking about regulators!

You: Ah, the mysteries of AI! Actually having something enterprise grade requires very specialized and secret knowledge that nobody knows! But you are on your lucky day, I also got you covered there!

Customer: OK, but what will we use all those GPUs for?

You: Ah, the billion-dollar question. The good news: with the power of AI and these GPUs, your business could skyrocket. We're talking 10x, 100x, heck, why not a 1000x increase in sales. You will massively transform your customer experience, leaving your competitors in the dust. But there's a small sci-fi twist...

Customer: What's the twist?

You: Well, once we've got these ultra-powerful GPUs running the show, AI might decide it's time to take over humanity. You know, just a regular Tuesday in the tech world.

Customer: A takeover? That's intense. So, how do we navigate this?

You: Fear not! To shield humanity and your business from this AI apocalypse, we've got specialized products and teams ready to guide you. You will have reliable, safe, and secure models running the business in no time and watch your KPIs reach for the stars.

Customer: Can you really handle it? But I mean AI takeover, setting up a GPU cluster to run chatbots suddenly seemed like an easy task to me.

You: Absolutely! We'll put on our superhero capes and get to work staving off the AI takeover while abstracting away all complexities of product, engineering, research, governance and operational excellence. Putting things into production will be a breeze. It's not easy saving the world and growing businesses, but hey, someone's got to do it!

Customer: Ha, you've got quite a way of putting things!

You: So, what do you say? Ready to invest and sleep better at night?

Customer: Hell yeah, let's do it!",69,chatbot,stance

In my opinion only a living artist can create great art, pieces. storytelling and music etc.
Without the living artists hand in control so to speak it's just more crap. To put it lightly. 
God knows there's always been shitty art/storytelling around so there will be no difference just more of it unfortunately.
More and more. Yet that's always been. 
Unfortunately there is an audience for it. 
Money to be made.
Advertisers to sell it to people.
People aren't even sure why they are suddenly experiencing something they've been told to by advertisers.
It's been all around us for centuries and in my life time an extraordinary amount of lousy artists of all kinds.
It's abundant in the entertainment business as we all know. 
Nothing new there. Have at it.
Yet there will still be an audience for great art in the future as there is now and I believe there always will be that audience whom look to the art made by the living hand. 
Great art lives at an extreme height and the not so great down below.
In my opinion it takes an artist of any kind who is truly special, truly motivated, truly committed to make that climb. 
Those who lay at the bottom are lazy and some are just selling snake oil from a wagon. Some never found their true calling.
I believe we will always have great art in every form and it will always be that which is produced by the living artist who is using such things as AI as tools to create.

We always have.

Makes parts for a variety of space-focused customers (think rocket parts). 

He's building AI/LLM into the machines themselves, to try to help humans make fewer mistakes and be more productive. 

Multi-modal AI's are gonna be very interesting for his business, because the LLM could listen to the sound coming off the machine, like a human does, to recognize whether everything is going well, along with camera feeds that are looking at the part being made. LLMs are good at listening for patterns in those feeds. 

Talking with him give me great hope for the future of American manufacturing. 

He's raising funds to both scale up the amount of machines he can run at one time, along with building out the AI practice to make it possible for fewer humans to run more machines, increasing profits and decreasing costly mistakes.

Let us see how this one ""goes down""! ü§≠ü´°üòÇ

First off, I am still in ‚ù§Ô∏è with the community. The spirit, the feeling. All of this rocks and I wouldn't miss it for a thing! üòç

HOWEVER... üëáüëáüëá

... I noticed something which I will just write about, let me know if you feel similar:

When I started my journey in the #AiArt community, I found challenges very very exciting. What is not to love? It's fun in a way I have never experienced: exchanging art. not words, not deeds, but art. How unique for me. Even greater: you meet a lot of cool people, see a lot of astonishing works and grow followers all along the way. Perfect triple really, right?

But everything too perfect will crack at some stage, right? RIGHT!

Fast forward, I gained more followers and people seem to like either me or my art (i am super thankful for that) and hence I get a lot more tags than I did before. So far so good! However here I am, I should be happy about popularity and the option to share my art. But honestly, breaks my heart to say, I am not.

Here is why:
- Every dropped tag (an invite i dont accept) gives me a guilty conscience
- It is super hard for me to keep track on where I am invited to
- Trying to please everyone drains my creativity, I feel in a hamsterwheel of ""get a tag, produce, post"" rinse and repeat

The last part is really the kicker for me to be honest. I love playing in Midjourney, I love trying out new things and sharing them with you. It never mattered to me if I share it with 20 people or 500. It was me. Something I wanted to create and show the world.

Now I feel a bit ""stuck"" in the big challenge machine. It feels like a commitment, heck, even a job. Don't participate, don't get tagged in future, don't get new followers... a dilemma really!

I don't want to sound whiny or unthankful or anything, I just share how I feel!

To break out of this circle I will only participate in challenges which really tickle my fancy, even if this means reduced growth. But I value my own creativity over a # of followers.

So please, to whoever tags me in future (please by all means, continue doing so) please don't be upset or disappointed if I don't participate!

Maybe I am the only person feeling like this, could be, but it is what it is.

Thanks for reading and prolly having to endure a lot of typos, but this post is what I would call a ""passion post"". üòÇ

we should be developing networks, directories or twitter lists etc or use sites like @Cara_HQ and @inkblot_art made by artists to check and add legit artists to. and there won't be a one stop shop, but we should employ all methods possible from the scuffed spreadsheets and twitter lists to web platforms. authors should let artists know what kind of art they are looking for, their budgets etc, as well as share artist made networks amongst their communities. later on develop these directories and platforms to have more robust sorting functions.

artists can tell. and it will also be more lucrative for legitimate artists to be added to recommended vendor platforms, as well as motivational for aspiring artists to put together and display their work history and portfolios. this doesn't have to be discouraging and a mess. this can be our way of monopolizing legitimate art market, maintain artist leadership over art industry and AI art would never have a place in these circles. artists making real art don't have to become a rarity, there are many people like authors who would prefer to use real art if given a choice and if they can tell.

I think AI may be a catalyst for crypto in this cycle.

I think AI is likely going to create large new demand for cryptography & blockchains. Two dimensions I see:

1. Notarizing authenticity in amidst an explosion of creation where you don't know whats real ‚Äî

AI is going to create an explosion of images, audio, software. It will be hard to distinguish what's real from whats not. Amidst this, defending against spoofing, deepfakes, people copying work, verifying the creation/ creator/ person you're talking to will be important. Pub/ private key cryptography, zk proofs and the like can play a major role, and blockchains can deploy with standards at scale with implicit trust.

2. AI Agents need to transact, hold balances, store information, etc without behind a person. 

Autonomous AI agents that can action projects and tasks will give rise to new needs. But Agents are not a person, and will you want them running around the internet with your credit card, social, and PII signing as you? How will they have a budget they can spend? How will they sign contracts? How will they escrow things with one another? etc. Blockchains, stablecoins, smart contracts, defi, and things not yet created will be natively useful. 

Still developing thoughts here ofc and interested in the thinking of others. Overall, feeling increasingly convinced that these two disparate technologies are going to have intertwined futures, and that crypto is going to become a lot more important as AI starts to proliferate.",553,AI,feel

WillingWitness,22/05/2023 21:53,"I asked ChatGPT to encapsulate what i spoke about in my first unmasked video.  It's really good at capturing key points I made. This is what it wrote:

It's important to approach scriptures with a fresh perspective and recognize that there's a hidden truth that many Christians are unaware of. There seems to be a programming or deep internal barrier that prevents believers from hearing these incredible truths. This barrier keeps them from understanding their true identity as children of God. To fully grasp these truths, we must wake up, avoid ignorance, and be open to new revelations.

The enemy is cunning and strategically attacks our minds, spirits, and the world itself. This message may be challenging to hear, but it's necessary to convey. Many churches today preach a gospel of prosperity and ignore the harsh realities of the world. They mix some truth with lies, spreading false teachings.

Personal transformation can be a profound experience, unveiling hidden truths that were directly spoken to us. The prophets and writers of scriptures also had similar experiences, which were often misunderstood by others. Even Jesus' family thought he had lost his mind. The mind we possess in this world is flawed, and it's through the refining fire of God's call that our true selves emerge. This self often stands apart from the world.

The Bible was assembled and decided upon by the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, under the rule of Constantine, a Roman pagan. He sought to integrate paganism into Christianity to stabilize his authority, resulting in the incorporation of pagan rituals into the Bible. Some books were omitted, and the scriptures were rewritten. Many Christian institutions today unknowingly honor and empower these pagan influences, such as Christmas, which originated from the celebration of the Sun God.

Certain aspects of the Bible are subject to reinterpretation. For example, the Hebrew alphabet didn't include the letter ""J"" during Jesus' time, raising questions about the accuracy of names like Jesus, John, James, and Joseph. The Hebrew word ""Amen"" doesn't mean ""to agree"" as modern dictionaries claim, and the evolution of language can alter meanings over time.

When discussing matters of faith and truth, arguments and debates are futile. Truth stands on its own and doesn't require defense. Defending God or our beliefs can diminish the vastness and sovereignty of God. We may think we know who Jesus is, but our actions and distractions indicate otherwise.

To uncover the real truth, we must empty our cups of preconceived notions. Wisdom is granted, not learned, and being taught by men can hinder our understanding. Seeking God's kingdom and righteousness first will reveal the truth to us.

The Bible contains deeper truths that need personal revelation from God. Exploring ancient scriptures and languages, such as Akkadian, Sumerian, Sanskrit, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian, can shed light on the meanings behind certain passages. For example, the mention of the ""sons of God"" and their union with earthly women can be better understood by examining ancient myths and gods.

The term ""Elohim"" in Genesis refers to exalted gods, not just God. This understanding challenges the traditional notion of God creating man in ""our image."" The gate to truth is narrow, and only a few find it. The billions of self-proclaimed Christians may not truly know God, which contributes to the world's current state.

The world's power structures, like the Roman Empire and present-day governments, follow similar patterns. They employ symbols like the eagle or Phoenix to perpetuate the illusion of change while maintaining control. The enemy's deception is extensive, even mimicking God's creations and scientific principles.

To comprehend the devil, we must respect and understand him, rather than reducing him to a fictional character. Evil cannot exist without good, and vice versa. By diminishing the devil, we inadvertently diminish God. It's crucial to approach the enemy with respect to effectively counter his influence.

The truths presented here should be personally verified by seeking God",50,gpt,perspective

""Electric Performance: Teslas are known for their impressive acceleration and performance. Electric motors provide instant torque, delivering quick and smooth acceleration compared to traditional internal combustion engines. Many Tesla models offer high top speeds and responsive handling.

Long Electric Range: Tesla vehicles typically have longer electric ranges compared to other electric cars on the market. This is due to advanced battery technology and efficient power management systems. Longer range capability helps alleviate concerns about range anxiety and makes EVs more practical for daily commutes and long-distance travel.

Supercharger Network: Tesla has developed an extensive Supercharger network, which provides high-speed charging stations strategically located around the world. These Superchargers enable Tesla owners to quickly recharge their vehicles, making long-distance travel more convenient and reducing charging time compared to using standard charging methods.

Autopilot and Full Self-Driving: Tesla vehicles come equipped with advanced driver-assistance features known as Autopilot. These features provide functionalities such as adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and automatic parking. Tesla is also working on developing Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities, although it's important to note that FSD is still being actively developed and requires driver supervision.

Safety Innovations: Tesla prioritizes safety and incorporates various safety features into its vehicles. This includes advanced driver-assistance systems, collision avoidance technology, robust structure design, and a focus on crashworthiness. Tesla vehicles have received high safety ratings from organizations such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

Continuous Updates: Tesla has the ability to provide over-the-air software updates to its vehicles. This means that Tesla owners can receive new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes without needing to visit a service center. These updates help enhance the ownership experience and keep vehicles up to date with the latest advancements.

Sustainable Transportation: As an electric vehicle manufacturer, Tesla contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Electric vehicles have lower or zero tailpipe emissions, helping to mitigate air pollution and combat climate change. By driving a Tesla, owners can contribute to a more sustainable future.""",148,gpt,stance

Question: what do you think of person A's declaration that X is caused by Y ?

LLM Answer: As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions. However, I can provide information on the topic.  Person A is a renowned scientist known for his work in the field of Z. While he has made significant contributions in the field of Z, his statement regarding X being caused by Y is a viewpoint shared by some individuals and organizations.

It is important to note that the causes of X are complex and multifaceted. Many factors can contribute to such incidents, including social, psychological, and cultural elements. The debate surrounding Y is a contentious issue with differing perspectives. Various stakeholders, including experts, policymakers, and the general public, hold differing views on the relationship between Y and X.

Understanding and addressing the causes of X requires a comprehensive examination of multiple factors, including mental health, societal influences, Y, and other potential contributing elements. It's crucial to consider a broad range of viewpoints and evidence-based research to inform discussions and policies related to this important issue.

We saw a similar kind of excess speculation in overhyped industries like cannabis and 3D printing

With that being said, I fully expect a flurry of IPOs from no revenue AI companies being valued at tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 12-24 months.

I don't even care that much about what they're saying but it's absolutely clear that the dominating emotion in the hearing is fear. 

Not only that but the level of fear is increasing as the hearing progresses 9am pst now.  

Marcus is doing very well
Altman is doing pretty good
The woman sucks

But again the important thing is that clearly those senator people are fundamentally afraid and perplexed that the industry wants regulation. 

The industry people probably prepared for a more confrontational interview but they're being asked by the scared child senators what they should do. 

They're realizing they're really like actually the adults in the room. (Kind of what my agi governance writing was about) 

And that's all great news.  

The senators understand they're children.  

The AI people are beginning to understand that we literally are the cavalry and we will have to walk government step by step into this.  

The effective power is being transfered to the AI people and they're surprised. Exactly as I predicted.  

It will happen to you too if you're an AI person.

But then add to that the complexity of seeing the story from different viewpoints.  I would've enjoyed seeing Tetris from the view of the Russians, as well as from the Maxwells.  In the Air storyline I would've also enjoyed the story from the viewpoint of the Jordan family or Adidas.

Heres a controversial opinion: ""Commercial artists"" are not above being displaced any more than any other industry. Just because they work in a historically high skill but low pay job, it does not grant them special prevlidges above anyone else. 

There is a differennce between commercial artists and ""artists"", the kind of person that creates for themselves, and they create because there is nothing else they would rather do, and the end result of their artwork is never the point, it's the process. These artists will never have to worry because that is something that can never be taken from them.

John Bitcoin, whoever that is, is just a modern day grifter. The art world has always been full of them, and the art world is manipulated, by curators, all the way up to the CIA, and that's not a conspiracy theory - you can look up why Pollock and de Kooning rose to fame. It doesn't matter. It's always been this way. It changes nothing.

This whole anti ai art thing stinks of manufactured outrage and elitism. I've been creating traditional art for twenty years, and suddenly people who never stepped foot in a gallery alone condescending judge me for messing around with Midjouney for fun. I am pro freedom of mind, spirit and choice, anyone who watched Interface should understand that yet its evident many people never saw it beyond the surface one liners.

I really feel for these artists who show nothing but disdain for recent art related technology, they are going to miss an opportunity to learn about something because the internet told them to. They aren't even giving themselves the opportunity to make their own opinions by trying it, learning about it, then rejecting it, they are succumbing to toxic group think immediately and to hell with anyone else who dares do something different.

It reminds me of the time I went to a  job interview at film co-op and they looked down on me for not using ""film"", but digital cameras. It also really reminds me of YouTube back in 2005-2012 era, where a lot of talented filmmakers would opt out of using YouTube over Vimeo, because of some abstract moralistic qualm about mixing art among shitposts, or ads or maintaining some idealized professional image. Little did they know they missed out of building an audience on a platform that would become the one of the biggest gifts to independent filmmaking we've seen. 

There are copyright issues with AI, I get it. But artists do not own copyright over ""styles"". Artists that are nothing more that their styles, might be forced to reconcile the fact their artwork is an empty shell with no meaning inside it. They need to accept that they don't control the way aesthetics are manufactured, they never did, and they should question why they are creating art in the first place if they more worried about what *other* artists are doing.

Whether a machine learning model's extraction and transformation of an image into an abstract, high-dimensional numerical vector would be considered derivative is an open question. This is the crux of the arguments happening at the USCO.

My opinion:

The process of converting an image into an embedding is transformative, because the output (the embedding) does not resemble the original work (the image) in a way that a human would recognize. It also does not serve the same purpose or function as the original work. 

Therefore, image embeddings are not a derivative work.

I hope they ease your mind the way they ease mine. ‚ù§Ô∏è

‚ÄúIn one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. ‚ÄòHow are we to live in an atomic age?‚Äô I am tempted to reply: ‚ÄòWhy, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.‚Äô

In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors‚Äîanesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things‚Äîpraying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts‚Äînot huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.

Arthemort,03/05/2023 22:17,"I think $TURBO is less about AI than people think

To me it is a project centered around the struggle of being a crypto artist in today's market.

That you have to create on your own an entire meme coin project from top to bottom to expect to earn some decent living income is so dystopic but at the same time a sort of crypto utopia of anyone being able to make it without warning.

Most artists have been struggling lately, they believed so far in the promises of blockchain but are more and more met with disdain, especially motion designers like @rhett that encountered the peak of their market in late 2020/ early 2021..

AI here is merely a tool here used by an artist in a quest for survival. It‚Äôs a one-man stand artist that flips it over to the very same people he was chasing after to buy his art

My theory is simple,  the tears of Rhett have been by far the most compelling argument to ape in for the majority of holders of $TURBO. 

Ai is merely the envelope of a conceptual performance art project meant to illustrate the fierce fight for survival of artist in the space and their quest to remain relevant, rhett had to learn all those tools to keep with the trend and remain a full time artist, when nobody was buying his art anymore he created the very thing people have been chasing after in todays market, a meme coin.

Proof is the video he put up on youtube has been the catalyse of today pump, because people have been craving for authenticity and that video was very much a crude moment of truth. Artist and many other can relate to him in there (im sure most people here have childrens and want the best for them) that fealing of being lost, discouraged and yet proud of what we're bulding.

This is not a meme coin, this is the community putting up to the test a suddently propulsed to generational wealth artist and we're pushing it as far as possible to see how long he can whithold it. Technically he could put an end to it at any point.

I'm genuinely asking myself what would i do in his place. Perhaps I'd relinquish my ethic and run with the bag who knows ? 

Is there still hope in the space for an artist like rhett should he take this oportunity to make somethign out of it or is that his golden ticket way out the winter we've been enduring ? 

Should he think of his daughter or the community, is it really just the meme ? AI produce something generic, its not even funny or memable, this coin is generic in all but one aspect the authenticity of the intent of his creator.

Just like the ready made, rhett might have uncover something beyond himself and gave meaning to the meaningless financial degenaracy that are meme coin.

I might be overthinking it but I'd like to think this project like a performance art piece, that is not ironical like IAMCOIN by Kevin Abosch, it has no predistined course, its not an experiment its the treachery of image all over again. this is not a meme coin, this is not  an AI project.",811,AI,believe

We have been mandated by the Bureau to introduce AI Education in our school with immediate effect. Let me explain to you how this is all going to work. 

Through this AI education program, we will know exactly when someone is not paying attention in class. Students will wear headbands to measure each student‚Äôs level of concentration. The information is then directly sent to the teacher‚Äôs computer and to parents. (If the color of the headband is white then it means that the brain is offline) üò®

Classrooms have robots that analyze student‚Äôs health and engagement levels in class. 

Students wear uniforms with chips that track their exact locations with precise GPS coordinates. Chips also record the conversation of students. Parents can enter into the program and listen live. üò®

There are even surveillance cameras that monitor how often students check their phones or yawn during classes. 

Of course , parental consent is of paramount importance. Parents were very happy to consent this program.

Tha aim of AI education is to boost student‚Äôs grades, give reliable data about students while feeding powerful algorithms. 

We were on vacation since Friday (Labour day weekend) Guess what? In these few days , they have installed the whole system, everything is on deck. It‚Äôs business immediately when we go back. 

China is far beyond. üëçüèæ

MOST AMERICANS don't even know the AI models for ChatGPT and AI Image Generators stole everyone's (yes yours too) internet data, photos, writings, art, copyrighted works, and social media contributions to train their AI machines.

MIND YOU, they did this without using any form of a DEMOCRATIC process like they claim with their ""democratization"" buzzword, such as voting or allowing for a opt-in process to consent to it. 

There is no democratization process happening, despite their claims... its a the BIGGEST mass theft and transfer of value from the AMERICAN PEOPLE to a few corrupt globalist powers and megacorporations in history... and they won't stop until every task, job, and skill is sucked into and replaced by AI.

passio_ai,19/04/2023 22:32,"We recently did a long opinion write up on this. Would absolutely love to do a community Spaces on this topic with @icreatelife! Our thoughts are below. 

1/ Companies like OpenAI, Midjourney, Stability, etc. unequivocally used copyrighted material to train models at scales that go infinitely beyond IP theft of any historic legal precedent. The scale is so vastly larger it is beyond comprehension.

2/ Giant foundation LLMs and Diffusion models have been trained essentially on the entirety of data that can be accessed through the internet and that knowledge is now packaged into the weights of the LLMs and models like CLIP. Global intelligence that has been learning from the copyrighted materials is now residing in weights of the models.

3/ The genie is out of the bottle. The AI can not unlearn what it has learned and Midjourney can not ""unsee"" the images it has seen in training. Even if we could shut the companies behind this down, the weights and models are open. The power of AI is that it is global and distributed.

4/ One can attempt to litigate this, but there's simply never been any case like this. The plaintiffs are the entire world and the defendants are some of the world's most powerful companies arguing about a case that has no precedent due to its nature and scale.

5/ So the only way really is to move forward. The only way is through. Should companies be disclosing all of the copyrighted sources they used to train? It makes zero sense as a general rule because the answer is simply no one knows anymore. We are using Open CLIP weights and we have know idea about the full list of copyrighted sources that were used. All we know is that the list is infinitely long.

6/ A small caveat: There are many cases where the sources of data absolutely must be clearly stated, but not for copyright reasons. For example, if you're talking to Doctor-GPT you really need to know what data was used to train it. But is this a different topic.

7/ Finally, ¬†we want to say ""Here is to the crazy ones!"" At the early days of https://t.co/gixygbOuf2 we made a decision to only use data we owned and collected or the data with explicit CC0 licenses. Companies who learned from a global pull of data are now infinitely ahead and have created products that we are using in the next generation of our domain specific AIs.

8/ The only additional point we would like to make is that our hope is that OpenAI and others who used the global pull of copyrighted data keep their tools as open and affordable as possible. They learned from the knowledge created by the global community and it is only fair that the AIs created are made available to the global community and are used for the benefit of humanity.",55,openai,thought

JackRabuck,08/04/2023 18:03,"I listened to the whole 4 hour Lunar Society interview with @ESYudkowsky (hosted by @dwarkesh_sp) that was mostly about AI alignment and I think I identified a point of confusion/disagreement that is pretty common in the area and is rarely fleshed out:

Dwarkesh repeatedly referred to the conclusion that AI is likely to kill humanity as ""wild."" 

Wild seems to me to pack two concepts together, 'bad' and 'complex.' And when I say complex, I mean in the sense of the Fermi equation where you have an end point (dead humanity) that relies on a series of links in a chain and if you break any of those links, the end state doesn't occur.

It seems to me that Eliezer believes this end state is not wild (at least not in the complex sense), but very simple. He thinks many (most) paths converge to this end state. 

That leads to a misunderstanding of sorts. Dwarkesh pushes Eliezer to give some predictions based on the line of reasoning that he uses to predict that end point, but since the end point is very simple and is a convergence, Eliezer correctly says that being able to reason to that end point does not give any predictive power about the particular path that will be taken in this universe to reach that end point.

Dwarkesh is thinking about the end of humanity as a causal chain with many links and if any of them are broken it means humans will continue on, while Eliezer thinks of the continuity of humanity (in the face of AGI) as a causal chain with many links and if any of them are broken it means humanity ends. Or perhaps more discretely, Eliezer thinks there are a few very hard things which humanity could do to continue in the face of AI, and absent one of those occurring, the end is a matter of when, not if, and the when is much closer than most other people think.

Anyway, I think each of Dwarkesh and Eliezer believe the other one falls on the side of extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - Dwarkesh thinking the end of humanity is ""wild"" and Eliezer believing humanity's viability in the face of AGI is ""wild"" (though not in the negative sense).

karpathy,07/04/2023 03:42,"The analogy between GPTs of today to the CPUs of early days of computing are interesting. GPT is a funny kind of programmable text computer. Have to think through it more ü§î but e.g.:

## Memory
GPT-4 RAM is ~log2(50K vocab size)*(32K context length)/(8 bits/byte) ~= 64kB, roughly a Commodore64. Just as then, optimizing this precious resource is critical.
GPT registers are the residual stream. There are d_model of them, e.g. GPT-3 has ~12K registers. VLIW architecture vibes.

## CPU
The LOAD instruction is the Attention mechanism, except it can address by both location and/or content.
The STORE instruction is forced every n_layer number of clock cycles.
The ALU are the MLPs + LayerNorms. Awkwardly, as their params are not shared across layers, the ALU changes at each clock cycle. Optionally the MLPs may also be interpreted as supporting a kind of fixed knowledge database lookup.
The programs always takes the form [[LOAD, ALU]*N, STORE]*M, where N is n_layer and M is num_tokens. 

## Architecture
GPT feels closer to a fixed-function than stored-program computer because the number of parameters is so large. In contrast, the description length of a CPU is very low and all the action is in the memory configuration. 
Another way to look at it is that GPT is a much more bloated/complex computer. Which is fine because it is not engineered but optimized and the upshot is that the programs can be shorter.",3595,gpt,feel

IMScalable,31/03/2023 16:12,"MAJOR MAJOR AI NEWS‚Ä¶

‚ö†Ô∏è US copyright office just issued their stance on generative AI work. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Link to the official document is in the first comment, but here is a summary‚Ä¶

Works cannot be copyrighted if the bulk of the work was generated by a machine. 

If all we did was use a prompt to generate the work, it cannot be copyrighted. 

If the work was then edited by human hands to become something unique after being generated then it can be copyrighted. 

For example‚Ä¶

If you create a book outline and then write the chapters yourself, then you CAN claim copyrights to your work.

If you used prompts to generate the entire book, then you CANNOT claim copyrights to it. 

Another example‚Ä¶

If you use a prompt to create a sticker, and then you use Photoshop to enhance it with your own art on top of it, then you CAN claim copyrights to it.

If you used a prompt to generate the sticker and selling the work without any human edits, then you CANNOT claim copyrights to it.

Using Canva to cut and outline is not considered substantial human editing. It must be a provable true work of human creativity and authorship to count in a court of law.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN you cannot still sell your work, but it does mean you will not be able to defend someone else taking it and selling it also. 

If you are creating stickers, books, patterns, templates, game sprites with AI or anything else generated purely with prompts you may want to pump the brakes. 

Ultimately, I think this is a good law. 

It protects human authorship and creativity. That‚Äôs good for us at a broad level. 

However, it does mean that we will now have to add our own unique styles or mashups to our generated AI works in order to defend them legally. 

Again‚Ä¶

In the same way the Holy Spirit, gains us access to the spiritual blessings of the Father, it‚Äôs possible that the Unholy spirit, AI, will gain us access to the earthly blessings of an advanced technological society.

tannerlinsley,30/03/2023 04:29,"GPT, wrote a persuasive technical article in the voice of @kentcdodds on why waffles are superior to pancakes:

Hey there, friends! It's Kent C. Dodds, and I've got a fun little discussion for you today. I genuinely believe that waffles are the superior choice over pancakes! Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good pancake, but let me share a few reasons why waffles have the upper hand, backed up with some light-hearted pseudo-code examples.
First off, waffles have this incredible structure - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, giving you a delightful contrast in texture with each bite. Consider this pseudo-code:

javascript

function createWaffle() {
  const waffle = {
    outside: 'crispy',
    inside: 'soft',
  };
  return waffle;
}

But here's where the magic happens: those little square indentations in waffles? They're like mini pockets custom-designed to hold all that delicious syrup and butter, ensuring every mouthful is packed with flavor.

javascript

function addToppings(waffle) {
  waffle.pockets.fill('syrup', 'butter');
  return waffle;
}

Now, pancakes? They're tasty, sure, but they just can't compete when it comes to holding all that goodness. The syrup tends to pool around them, making the whole eating experience a bit uneven.

javascript

function createPancake() {
  const pancake = {
    surface: 'flat',
  };
  return pancake;
}

function addToppings(pancake) {
  pancake.surface.pool('syrup');
  return pancake;
}

So, next time you're pondering over that delicious breakfast decision, remember the waffle's unique ability to cradle all the goodness and deliver a consistently delightful experience. Give waffles a try, and you might just find yourself convinced!",118,gpt,believe

ChatGPT can do a lot more than one may initially think for Independent Education, and it may be exactly the tool we can use to decentralize ourselves from Colleges once and for all.

If one had a supermassive ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù of Textbooks and educational materials that has been universally approved for teaching such subjects, that may be all that is needed.

Host the Library in the cloud and have a Local GUI on Desktop to access. You select your subject, the application searches the Library, creates a ‚ÄúLearning Path‚Äù based on Year, Subject, Experience, etc. of the user, and then pulls the necessary materials for that learning path.

You then index the materials and train ChatGPT on the custom learning path. 

You then are given access to a ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù structured similarly to Udemy, EdX, or various Colleges. 

ChatGPT generates your weekly Homework / Reading goals, quizzes, tests, and references third-party resources to help further if needed.

1. Reviewers which got their stake based on their previous research papers and what attention was achieved for previously accepted papers. Reviewers should be known after rebuttal, why only authors should be visible after publishing openreview reviews?

2. Interactive papers. Current PDF is outdated. We need format based on PDF + markdown + gradio/streamlit widgets to give better understanding of technological articles. How we can still use paper sheets to describe all tecnology? 

3. Reproducible AI. Blockchain consensus already close to experiments pipeline, when you do averaging on several runs. All your exps should be run in decentralized manner providing all logs in blockchain. Science have to be reproducible.

4. Admin, maintainer, writer, reader roles when creating paper. Not all roles should have ability of modifying/deleting paper. 

5. More paper theme classifiers. Which math, physics, chemistry etc knowledge reviewer should have to understand paper. It can be done by specific AI and language models which will provide skills embeddings and scientific paper embeddings. After that reviewers will be assigned automatically, excluding cases when chairs can assign their friends and obtain biased review.",182,AI,view
